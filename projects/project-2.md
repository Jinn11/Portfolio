summary: A responsive Counter web application for Calculating that I developed in CUNY TechWorks at QCC.

Counter is a web application that I helped create as a solo project in CUNY Tech Works, Spring 2019. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

Counter is implemented using [React](http://React.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within one weeks, we created a website that implements several types of Calcuting.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
